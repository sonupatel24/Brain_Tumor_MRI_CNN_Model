#Brain Tumor MRI Classification using CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain MRI images into different tumor categories. The workflow includes:

Automatic dataset download from Kaggle (Brain Tumor MRI dataset).

Data preprocessing with normalization, augmentation, and train/validation split using ImageDataGenerator.

A custom CNN model with convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers, optimized with Adam.

Model training and evaluation on MRI scans to detect tumor types.

Visualization of class distribution and training metrics.

ðŸš€ Tech stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
